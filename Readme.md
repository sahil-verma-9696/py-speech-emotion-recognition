# 🎙️ Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)
This project is an open-source Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system that detects and classifies human emotions from audio using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It enables machines to understand emotional states like anger, happiness, sadness, neutral, and more based on speech signals.

## 🚀 Features
🔊 Preprocessing and feature extraction (MFCC, Chroma, Mel spectrogram)

🤖 Model training using deep learning (CNN, LSTM, etc.)

🧠 Emotion classification with high accuracy
